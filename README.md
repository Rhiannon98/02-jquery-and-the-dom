## Over View ##
Here we are attempting to provide CSS to make a more consistent user experience for mobile and desktop user interfaces. We have added jQuery to ensure that each blogAricle object from the array has the same affect as well as the same layout onto the page. Further more, we have drop down menus to ensure that if there is a mobile user, then there is no worry about the menu looking weird and awkward.

## Getting Started ##
To access all files
--> clone (or fork if editting at all) the fill into your personal device
--> cd into rhi-max file
--> open index.html to see if code works properly (or not)
--> judge or correct as needed

To access the broken html example
--> cd into rhi-max
--> open broken.html
--> you can compare to index.html 
--> and you now can compare both html 'sites'
--> one will not work, the other will kinda work

## Architecture ##
-- jQuery library being used for easier writing of JS code by providing 'shortcuts'
-- HTML and CSS languages used for look and layout
-- JavaScript(JS) used for functionality
